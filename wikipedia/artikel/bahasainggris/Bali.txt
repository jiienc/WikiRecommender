Bali
Bali (/ˈbɑːli/; Balinese: ᬩᬮᬶ ) is a province of Indonesia
and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of
Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island
of Bali and a few smaller offshore islands, notably Nusa
Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan to the
southeast. The provincial capital, Denpasar,[7] is the most
populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the secondlargest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The upland
town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's
cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist
destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the
1980s.[8] Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its
economy.[9]
Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with
86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.[3] It
is renowned for its highly developed arts, including
traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather,
metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film
Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events
that have been held in Bali include Miss World 2013, the
2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank Group and the 2022 G20 summit. In
March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top
destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also
earned in January 2021.[10][11]

Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest
biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles.[12]
In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can
be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many
as in the entire Caribbean.[13] Bali is the home of the Subak
irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[14] It is
also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed
of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a
specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor

by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated
before Dutch colonisation.[15]

History
Ancient
Bali was inhabited around 2000 BCE by Austronesian
people who migrated originally from the island of Taiwan to
Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast
Asia.[16][17] Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are
closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago,
Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Oceania.[17] Stone
tools dating from this time have been found near the village
of Cekik in the island's west.[18][19]
In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, the Pasupata,
Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava, Bodha, Brahma, Resi,
Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its
personal Godhead.[20]
Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until
914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal
an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where Buddhism
and Shaivism were practised simultaneously. Mpu Sindok's
great-granddaughter,
Mahendradatta
(Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana
Warmadewa (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving
birth to Airlangga around 1001. This marriage also brought
more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess
Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from
1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150.
Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181,
while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in
1204.[21]: 129, 144, 168, 180
Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese,
and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st
century AD. The name Bali dwipa ("Bali island") has been
discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong
pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914
AD and mentioning Walidwipa. It was during this time that
the people developed their complex irrigation system subak
to grow rice in wet-field cultivation. Some religious and
cultural traditions still practised today can be traced to this
period.

The Hindu Majapahit Empire (1293–1520 AD) on eastern
Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of
Hayam Wuruk is mentioned in the charters of 1384–86. Mass
Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the
Majapahit Empire fell in 1520.[21]: 234, 240 Bali's government then
became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to
a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture,
arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became
independent for up to 386 years until 1906 when the Dutch
subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took
it over.[22]

Subak irrigation system

Portuguese contacts
The first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese
expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serrão sighted its northern shores. It was the first
expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century travelled along
the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard
the expedition.[23] In 1585, a ship foundered off the Bukit Peninsula and left a few Portuguese in the
service of Dewa Agung.[24]

Dutch East Indies
In 1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived at Bali, and the
Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. The Dutch
government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during
the second half of the 19th century. Dutch political and economic control
over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast when the Dutch
pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.[25] In the late
1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms on the island's south were
exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.
In June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, travelled
to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island.
Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his Wallace
Line theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the
strait between Bali and Lombok. It is a boundary between species. In his
travel memoir The Malay Archipelago, Wallace wrote of his experience in
Bali, which has a strong mention of the unique Balinese irrigation methods:

Puputan monument

I was astonished and delighted; as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so
beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from
the seacoast about ten or twelve miles (16 or 19 kilometres) inland, where it is bounded by a
fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of
coconut palms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while
between them extend luxurious rice grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that
would be the pride of the best-cultivated parts of Europe.[26]

The Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the
thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch
force committed ritual suicide (puputan) to avoid the humiliation of surrender.[25] Despite Dutch demands
for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.[27] In the Dutch
intervention in Bali, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung.
Afterwards, the Dutch governours exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over
religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well
established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and Maluku.
In the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter
Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples
created a western image of Bali as "an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature".
Western tourists began to visit the island.[28] The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a
quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary Virgins of Bali about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls
whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene "bathe their shamelessly nude bronze
bodies".[29]: 134 Under the looser version of the Hays code that existed up to 1934, nudity involving
"civilised" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with "uncivilised" (i.e. all non-white women), a
loophole that was exploited by the producers of Virgins of Bali.[29]: 133 The film, which mostly consisted of
scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into
a popular spot for tourists.[29]: 135
Imperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East
Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on Borneo were inoperative due to heavy rains, the Imperial Japanese
Army decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular
Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps Prajoda
(Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the
command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces
landed near the town of Sanoer (Sanur). The island was quickly captured.[30]
During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, I Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese
'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch
colonial rulers.[31]

Independence from the Dutch
In 1945, Bali was liberated by the British 5th infantry Division under the command of Major-General
Robert Mansergh who took the Japanese surrender. Once Japanese forces had been repatriated the island
was handed over to the Dutch the following year.
In 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State
of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno
and Hatta. Bali was included in the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" when the Netherlands
recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.[32] The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung
Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.[33]

Contemporary
The 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed thousands, created economic havoc, and forced many displaced
Balinese to be transmigrated to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across
Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional caste

system, and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was
represented by supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and
the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further
increased by the PKI's land reform programmes.[25] A purported coup
attempt in Jakarta was averted by forces led by General Suharto.
The army became the dominant power as it instigated a violent anticommunist purge, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most
estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia,
with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's
population.[25][28][34] With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and
Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI
members.[34]

2002 Bali bombings
memorial

As a result of the 1965–66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre
Sukarno out of the presidency. His "New Order" government reestablished relations with Western countries. The pre-War Bali as
"paradise" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic
increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.[25]
A bombing in 2002 by militant Islamists in the tourist area of Kuta killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.
This attack, and another in 2005, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship on the
island.
On 27 November 2017, Mount Agung erupted five times, causing an evacuation of thousands, disrupting
air travel and environmental damage. Further eruptions also occurred between 2018 and 2019.[35]

Geography

Aerial photograph of Bali

The island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2.0 mi) east of Java, and is
approximately 8 degrees south of the equator. Bali and Java are
separated by the Bali Strait. East to west, the island is
approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately
112 km (70 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km2
(2,230 sq mi), or 5,577 km2 (2,153 sq mi) without Nusa Penida
District,[36] which comprises three small islands off the southeast
coast of Bali. Its population density was roughly 747 people/km2
(1,930 people/sq mi) in 2020.

Bali's central mountains include several peaks over 2,000 metres
(6,600 feet) in elevation
and active volcanoes such
as Mount Batur. The
highest is Mount Agung
(3,031 m, 9,944 ft), known
as the "mother mountain",

next 100 years.
In late 2017 Mount Agung started erupting and large numbers of people were

evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport.[38] Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with
Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its
tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of
the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The
northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the
island, along with rice, vegetables, and cattle. The longest river, Ayung River, flows approximately 75 km
(47 mi) (see List of rivers of Bali).
The island is surrounded by coral reefs. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the
north and west have black sand. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small
sampan boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but
apart from the seaside temple of Tanah Lot, they are not yet used for significant tourism.
The largest city is the provincial capital, Denpasar, near the
southern coast. Its population is around 726,800 (mid 2022). Bali's
second-largest city is the old colonial capital, Singaraja, which is
located on the north coast and is home to around 150,000 people in
2020.[39][40] Other important cities include the beach resort, Kuta,
which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and Ubud,
situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.[41]
Three small islands lie to the immediate south-east and all are
administratively part of the Klungkung regency of Bali: Nusa
Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. These islands are
separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.

To the east, the Lombok Strait separates Bali from Lombok and marks the biogeographical division
between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition
is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone
between these two major biomes. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, Bali was
connected to Java and Sumatra and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water
of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated.

Climate
Being just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round
temperature stands at around 30 °C (86 °F) with a humidity level of about 85%.[42]
Daytime temperatures at low elevations vary between 20 to 33 °C (68 to 91 °F), but the temperatures
decrease significantly with increasing elevation.
The west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain,
particularly from December to March. During the rainy season, there are comparatively fewer tourists seen
in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays, the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the
monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.

Ecology
Bali lies just to the west of the Wallace Line,[43] and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very
little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok.[44] An exception is the
yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of

birds, including the critically endangered Bali myna, which is endemic.
Others include barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed
treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, Java sparrow,
lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped
swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, woodswallow, savanna nightjar,
stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.

Bali myna (Leucopsar
rothschildi) is found only on
Bali and is critically
endangered.

Until the early 20th century, Bali was possibly home to several large
mammals: banteng, leopard and the endemic Bali tiger. The banteng still
occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in
neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a
tiger on Bali dates from 1937 when one was shot, though the subspecies
may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.[45] Pleistocene and Holocene
megafaunas include banteng and giant tapir (based on speculations that
they might have reached up to the Wallace Line),[46] and rhinoceros.[47]

Squirrels are quite commonly
encountered, less often is the Asian
palm civet, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce kopi
luwak. Bats are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to
encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats)
where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a
tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for
instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of monkey occur. The
crab-eating macaque, known locally as "kera", is quite common
Monkeys in Uluwatu
around human settlements and temples, where it becomes
accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three
"monkey forest" temples, such as the popular one in the Ubud area. They are also quite often kept as pets
by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and
more elusive and is the Javan langur, locally known as "lutung". They occur in a few places apart from the
West Bali National Park. They are born an orange colour, though they would have already changed to a
more blackish colouration by their first year. In Java, however, there is more of a tendency for this species
to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen
together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the leopard cat, Sunda pangolin and black giant squirrel.
Snakes include the king cobra and reticulated python. The water monitor can grow to at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft)
in length and 50 kg (110 lb)[48] and can move quickly.
The rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as Tulamben, Amed,
Menjangan or neighbouring Nusa Penida, host a wide range of marine life, for instance hawksbill turtle,
giant sunfish, giant manta ray, giant moray eel, bumphead parrotfish, hammerhead shark, reef shark,
barracuda, and sea snakes. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near Singaraja and
Lovina.[49]
A team of scientists surveyed from 29 April 2011, to 11 May 2011, at 33 sea sites around Bali. They
discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, Nusa Dua,
Tulamben and Candidasa, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at Padangbai and between
Padangbai and Amed.[50] The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in Raja Ampat
and Halmahera by 29% or in Fakfak and Kaimana by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang
and Gili Mimpang in Candidasa, Karangasem Regency.[51]

Among the larger trees the most common are: banyan trees, jackfruit, coconuts, bamboo species, acacia
trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: hibiscus,
frangipani, bougainvillea, poinsettia, oleander, jasmine, water lily, lotus, roses, begonias, orchids and
hydrangeas exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance, around Kintamani, certain
species of fern trees, mushrooms and even pine trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other
plants with agricultural value include: salak, mangosteen, corn, Kintamani orange, coffee and water
spinach.[52]

Environment
Over-exploitation by the tourist industry has led to 200 out of 400
rivers on the island drying up. Research suggests that the southern
part of Bali would face a water shortage.[53] To ease the shortage,
the central government plans to build a water catchment and
processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres
capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar,
Badung and Gianyar in 2013.[54]
Uluwatu
A 2010 Environment Ministry report on its environmental quality
index gave Bali a score of 99.65, which was the highest score of
Indonesia's 33 provinces. The score considers the level of total
suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand in water.[55]

Erosion at Lebih Beach has seen seven metres (23 feet) of land lost every year. Decades ago, this beach
was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to Masceti
Beach.[56]
In 2017, a year when Bali received nearly 5.7 million tourists, government officials declared a "garbage
emergency" in response to the covering of 3.6-mile stretch of coastline in plastic waste brought in by the
tide, amid concerns that the pollution could dissuade visitors from returning.[57] Indonesia is one of the
world's worst plastic polluters, with some estimates suggesting the country is the source of around 10 per
cent of the world's plastic waste.

Government
Politics
In the national legislature, Bali is represented by nine members.[58] The Bali Regional People's
Representative Council, the provincial legislature, has 55 members.[59] The province's politics has
historically been dominated by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which has won by far
the most votes in every election in Bali since the first free elections in 1999.[60]

Administrative divisions
The province is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota). These are, with their areas and
their populations at the 2010 census[61] and the 2020 census,[40] together with the official estimates as at
mid 2022[62] and the Human Development Index for each regency and city.

Economy
In the 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and
employment.[64] Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one
of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related.[9] By the
end of June 2011, the rate of non-performing loans of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average
of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan rates (about 5%).[65] The economy, however, suffered
significantly as a result of the Islamists' terrorist bombings in 2002 and 2005. The tourism industry has since
recovered from these events.

Agriculture
Although tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is
still the island's biggest employer.[66] Fishing also provides a
significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its artisans who
produce a vast array of handicrafts, including batik and ikat cloth
and clothing, wooden carvings, stone carvings, painted art and
silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single
product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.
Wood carving

The Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of
Kintamani near Mount Batur. Generally, Balinese coffee is
processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours

include lemon and other citrus notes.[67] Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional
farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of "Tri Hita Karana".
According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and
the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic
coffee production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a geographical
indication.[68]

Tourism
In 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur was built by Sukarno and
boosted tourism in Bali. Before the Bali Beach Hotel construction, No.
there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the 1
island.[71] Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread
2
throughout Bali. Tourism further increased in Bali after the
Ngurah Rai International Airport opened in 1970. The Buleleng 3
regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the 4
mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.
The tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while also
significant in the other parts of the island. The prominent tourist
locations are the town of Kuta (with its beach), and its outer
suburbs of Legian and Seminyak (which were once independent
townships), the east coast town of Sanur (once the only tourist
hub), Ubud towards the centre of the island, to the south of the
Ngurah Rai International Airport, Jimbaran and the newer
developments of Nusa Dua and Pecatu.

The United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008.
The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May
2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a
high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new
warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012, because of one tourist who died
from methanol poisoning.[72] Australia last issued an advisory on
Monday, 5 January 2015, due to new terrorist threats.[73]
An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's
Kuta Beach is a popular tourist spot.
real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of
Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the
island's south side. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with
commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are
fairly active, and investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the
worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.
In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar,
providing many overseas visitors with improved value for their currencies.
Bali's tourism economy survived the Islamists terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism
industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the long-term trend has been a
steady increase in visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the

target of 2.0–
2.3
million
tourists. The

Bali received the Best Island award from Travel and
Leisure in 2010.[75] Bali won because of its attractive
surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas),
diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and
local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local
people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also
considered the main factor of the award. One of the
most prestigious events that symbolize a strong
relationship between a god and its followers is Kecak
dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011,
Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second
after Santorini, Greece.[76]

In 2006, Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray, Love
was published, and in August 2010 it was adapted into the film Eat Pray Love. It took place at Ubud and
Padang-Padang Beach in Bali. Both the book and the film fuelled a boom in tourism in Ubud, the hill town
and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance and love through traditional
spirituality and healing.[77]
In January 2016, after musician David Bowie died, it was revealed that in his will, Bowie asked for his
ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to Buddhist rituals. He had visited and performed in several
Southeast Asian cities early in his career, including Bangkok and Singapore.[78]
Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still
tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists. Chinese tourists increased by 17%
from last year due to the impact of ACFTA and new direct flights to Bali.[79] In January 2012, Chinese
tourists increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% year
on year.[80]
Bali authorities reported the island had 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012,
marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.[81]
Based on a Bank Indonesia survey in May 2013, 34.39 per cent of tourists are upper-middle class,
spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, India, France, China, Germany and
the UK. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 per cent

of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285.[82] In 2017 it was expected that Chinese
tourists would outnumber Australian tourists.
In January 2020, 10,000 Chinese tourists cancelled trips to Bali due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[83]
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, Bali welcomed 1.07 million international travelers
in 2020, most of them between January and March, which is -87% compared to 2019. In the first half of
2021, they welcomed 43 international travelers.[84] The pandemic presented a major blow on Bali´s
tourism-dependent economy. On 3 February 2022, Bali reopened again for the first foreign tourists after 2
years of being closed due to the pandemic.[85]
In 2022 Indonesia's Minister of Health, Budi Sadikin, stated that the tourism industry in Bali will be
complemented by the medical industry.[86]
At the beginning of 2023, the governor of Bali demanded a ban on the use of motorcycles by tourists. This
happened after a series of accidents. Wayan Koster proposed to cancel the violators' visas. The move
sparked widespread outrage on social media.[87]

Transportation
The Ngurah Rai International Airport is located near Jimbaran, on
the isthmus at the southernmost part of the island. Lt. Col. Wisnu
Airfield is in northwest Bali.
A coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries
cross the central mountains at passes reaching 1,750 m in height (at
Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that
partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines. There is a car
ferry between Gilimanuk on the west coast of Bali to Ketapang on
Java.

I Gusti Ngurah Rai International
Airport

In December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors
to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at Karangasem, Bali with a projected worth of
$30 million.[88] On 17 July 2011, the first cruise ship (Sun Princess) anchored about 400 metres (1,300
feet) away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only 154 metres (505 feet) but will
eventually be extended to 300 to 350 metres (980–1,150 feet) to accommodate international cruise ships.
The harbour is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains
and green rice fields.[89] The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the
situation was unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at
Tanah Ampo.[90]
A memorandum of understanding was signed by two ministers,
Bali's governor and Indonesian Train Company to build 565
kilometres (351 miles) of railway along the coast around the island.
As of July 2015, no details of these proposed railways have been
released.[91][92] In 2019 it was reported in Gapura Bali that Wayan
Koster, governor of Bali, "is keen to improve Bali's transportation
infrastructure and is considering plans to build an electric rail
network across the island".[93]

On 16 March 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port received the "Best Port Welcome 2010" award from London's
"Dream World Cruise Destination" magazine.[94] Government plans to expand the role of Benoa port as
export-import port to boost Bali's trade and industry sector.[95] In 2013, The Tourism and Creative
Economy Ministry advised that 306 cruise liners were scheduled to visit Indonesia, an increase of 43 per
cent compared to the previous year.[96]
In May 2011, an integrated Area Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at
four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing.
ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a
monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN
countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.[97][98]
On 21 December 2011, construction started on the Nusa DuaBenoa-Ngurah Rai International Airport toll road, which will also
provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by
seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of
the shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the 9.91kilometre-long (6.16-mile) toll road (totally 12.7 kilometres (7.89
miles) with access road). The construction is estimated to cost
Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through 2
Bali Mandara Toll Road
kilometres (1 mile) of mangrove forest and through 2.3 kilometres
(1.4 miles) of beach, both within 5.4 hectares (13 acres) area. The
elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars that occupied two hectares of
mangrove forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21
December 2011, the Dewa Ruci 450-metre (1,480-foot) underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci
junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136 billion ($14.9 million) from the state
budget.[99][100][101] On 23 September 2013, the Bali Mandara Toll Road was opened, with the Dewa Ruci
Junction (Simpang Siur) underpass being opened previously.[102]
To solve chronic traffic problems, the province will also build a toll road connecting Serangan with
Tohpati, a toll road connecting Kuta, Denpasar, and Tohpati, and a flyover connecting Kuta and Ngurah
Rai Airport.[103]

Demographics
The population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 census, and
4,317,404 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2022
was 4,415,100.[105] There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates
living in Bali.[106]

Ethnic origins
A DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al.[107] found that 12% of
Balinese Y-chromosomes are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are
of likely Austronesian origin, and 2% of likely Melanesian origin.

Pre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis
state, but with a "very strong tradition of communal decisionmaking and interdependence".[108] The four castes have been
classified as Sudra (Shudra), Wesia (Vaishyas), Satria (Kshatriyas)
and Brahmana (Brahmin).[109]

The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich
suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but
Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited
and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations
conflicted with the "received understandings concerning its Indian
sources:[104]
origins".[110] In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelt Soedra) has typically
been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a
temple priest may also be from the other three castes.[111] In most regions, it has been the Shudra who
typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite meweda
(Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.[111]

Religion
About 86.91% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism,
formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences
from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions
include Islam (10.05%), Christianity (2.35%), and Buddhism (0.68%)
as for 2018.[4][112]

However, officially, the Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism
as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national
ideology.[113][114][115] Indonesian school textbooks describe Hinduism as having one supreme being,
Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part
parallel those of Islam.[114][116] Scholars[114][117][118] contest whether these Indonesian government
recognised and assigned beliefs to reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before
Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.
Balinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, which arrived through Java.[119] Hindu
influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century.[120] Historical evidence is
unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era,

traced to 78 AD. Stories from the Mahabharata Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st
century; however, the versions mirror those found in the southeast Indian peninsular region (now Tamil
Nadu and southern Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh).[120]
The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of
the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that
the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of
nature, therefore, possesses its power, which reflects the power of
the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home
for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese
Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states
of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among
the people, who for this reason have become famous for their
graceful and decorous behaviour.[121]

Pura Ulun Danu Bratan

Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist Chinese immigrants whose traditions have
melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese embrace their original religion, which is a
mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and Confucianism, and find a way to harmonise it with the
local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's odalan.
Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the
death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative
purposes, such as their Identity Cards.[122] The Roman Catholic community has a diocese, the Diocese of
Denpasar that encompasses the province of Bali and West Nusa Tenggara and has its cathedral located in
Denpasar.

Language
Balinese and Indonesian are the most widely spoken languages in
Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are bilingual or
trilingual. The most common spoken language around the tourist
areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not
solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and
other parts of Indonesia. The Balinese language is heavily stratified
due to the Balinese caste system.[123] Kawi and Sanskrit are also
commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature
was mostly written in Sanskrit.

Balinese language

English and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many
Balinese, owing to the requirements of the tourism industry, as well as the English-speaking community
and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as Japanese, Korean, French,
Russian or German are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.

Culture
Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as
painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts.
Balinese cuisine is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra
music, known as gamelan, is highly developed and varied.
Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics
such as the Ramayana but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous
Balinese dances include pendet, legong, baris, topeng, barong,
gong keybar, and kecak (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the
most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world,
with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private
ceremonies, and public shows.[124]

Balinese cuisine

Architecture
Kaja and kelod are the Balinese equivalents of North and South,
which refer to one's orientation between the island's largest
mountain Gunung Agung (kaja), and the sea (kelod). In addition to
spatial orientation, kaja and kelod have the connotation of good and
evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain
whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and
residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred
spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the
sea.[125][126]
Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which
are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest kaja. These spaces
serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are
accompanied by any combination of music, dance, and drama. The
performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as
wali, the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the
gods, while the outer courtyard is where bebali ceremonies are
held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances
meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the
temple's walls and are called bali-balihan. This three-tiered system
of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of
Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the
oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a
paying audience.[127]

Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for
entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact
of tourism is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts
did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective
ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the barong dance have been performed both in their
original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these
performances that have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a
barong mask specifically for non-ritual performances and an older mask that is only used for sacred
performances.[128]

Festivals
Throughout the year, there are many festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional
calendars.[129] The Hindu New Year, Nyepi, is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day
everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day
before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of Ogoh-ogoh monsters are paraded and burned in the
evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese
pawukon calendrical system.
Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or odalan
(temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of
désa kala patra, which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and
general social context.[125] Many ceremonial art forms such as wayang kulit and topeng are highly
improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.[130]
Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with much activity, and the resulting aesthetic,
ramé, is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more gamelan ensembles will be performing well within
earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst
themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of
activity and the liveliness typical of ramé.[131]

Tradition
Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and
religion is closely tied.[132] Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as customary law sanctions
imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including "kasepekang", or shunning) have risen
in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.[132]
Other than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents Bali Arts Festival to showcase
Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a
year, from the second week of June until the end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words
and ideas Ubud Writers and Readers Festival is held at Ubud in October, which is participated by the
world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers, and performers.[133]
One unusual tradition is the naming of children in Bali. In general, Balinese people name their children
depending on the order they are born, and the names are the same for both males and females.

Beauty pageant

Bali was the host of Miss World 2013 (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time
Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant. In 2022, Bali also co-hosted Miss Grand International
2022 alongside with Jakarta, West Java, and Banten.

Sports
Bali is a major world surfing destination with popular breaks dotted
across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of
Nusa Lembongan.[134]
As part of the Coral Triangle, Bali, including Nusa Penida, offers a
wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs, and tropical
aquatic life.
Bali was the host of 2008 Asian Beach Games.[135] It was the
second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level multi-sport event, after
Jakarta held the 1962 Asian Games.

Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium, the
home of Bali United F.C.

In football, Bali is home to Bali United football club, which plays
in Liga 1. The team was relocated from Samarinda, East Kalimantan to Gianyar, Bali. Harbiansyah
Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the home
base because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia.[136] Another
reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support Pusamania Borneo F.C. rather than
Persisam.

Heritage sites
In June 2012, Subak, the irrigation system for paddy fields in Jatiluwih, central Bali was enlisted as a
Natural UNESCO World Heritage Site.[137]
