Indonesia
Indonesia,[a] officially the Republic of Indonesia,[b] is a country in
Southeast Asia and Oceania between the Indian and Pacific oceans. It                Republic of Indonesia
consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and          Republik Indonesia (Indonesian)
parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest
archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569
square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 280 million
people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the
most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous
island, is home to more than half of the country's population.
                                                                                          Flag               National emblem
As the world's third largest democracy, Indonesia is a presidential republic                                  (Coat of arms)
with an elected legislature. It has 38 provinces, of which nine have special                     Motto:

The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at                            Pancasila
least the seventh century, when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links                    (lit. 'Five principles')
with China. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers
drawn to its natural resources. Under Indian influence, Hindu and
Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE. Muslim
traders later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to
monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of
Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism,
Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. Indonesia's history
has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters,
corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid
economic change.

Indonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of
linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has
developed with the motto "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" ("Unity in Diversity"
literally, "many, yet one"), defined by a national language, cultural
diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a
history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia
is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It
is a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs.
The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including
the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding
member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic
Cooperation.

                                          The first Europeans arrived in the archipelago
                                          in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by
                                          Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the
                                          sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper
                                          in the Maluku Islands.[34] Dutch and British
                                          traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch
                                          established the Dutch East India Company
                                          (VOC) and became the dominant European

over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in
quelling rebellions both on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince
Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, and the bloody 30-year war in Aceh
weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.[36][37][38] Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance
extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.[38][39][40][41]

The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule[42][43][44] and encouraged the
previously suppressed independence movement.[45] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and
Mohammad Hatta, influential nationalist leaders, proclaimed Indonesian independence and were appointed president and
vice-president, respectively.[46][47][48][46]

The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949
when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure.[49][48] Despite
extraordinary political, social, and sectarian divisions, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for
independence.[50][51]


Post-World War II




                   Sukarno (left) and Hatta (right), Indonesia's founding fathers and the first President and Vice President respectively


As president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the
opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[52]
Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General
Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and
incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps.[53][54][55][56] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively
destroyed.[57][58][59] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with
Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968. His "New Order" administration,[60] supported by the United
States,[61][62][63] encouraged foreign direct investment,[64][65][66] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades
of substantial economic growth.
Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[67] It brought out popular discontent with the New
Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[42][68][69][70] In 1999,
East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia[71] and a 25-year occupation marked by
international condemnation of human rights abuses.[72]

Since 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first
direct presidential election in 2004.[73] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism
remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly in the last 15 years. Although relations
among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some
areas.[74] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[75]


Geography
Indonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E. A
transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's
largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west
and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south. The country's Coordinating
Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands
(with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around
6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with      Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in
Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New                     East Java. Indonesia's seismic and
Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik,           volcanic activity is among the world's
Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor,          highest.
and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and
Australia.

At 4,884 metres (16,024 ft), Puncak Jaya is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra is the largest lake, with an
area of 1,145 km2 (442 sq mi). Indonesia's largest rivers are in Kalimantan and New Guinea and include Kapuas, Barito,
Mamberamo, Sepik and Mahakam. They serve as communication and transport links between the island's river
settlements.[79]


Climate

                                        Indonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-
                                        round.[80] Indonesia has two seasons—a wet season and a dry season—with no
                                        extremes of summer or winter.[81] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls
                                        between May and October, with the wet season between November and April.[81]
                                        Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest
                                        climate found on every large island of Indonesia. More cooling climate types do exist
                                        in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea
Rainforest in Mount Palung National     level. The oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) prevails in highland areas adjacent to
Park, West Kalimantan                   rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland
                                        areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical
                                        highland climate (Köppen Cwb) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.

Some regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in
rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa
Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry
season and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western
Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to
Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tends to be dry. The almost uniformly warm
waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that land temperatures remain   Köppen-Geiger climate classification
relatively constant. Humidity is quite high, at between 70 and 90%. Winds are         map of Indonesia[82]
moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the
south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through
March. Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in
channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.[83]
Several studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the projected effects of climate change.[84] These include
unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around 1 °C (2 °F) by mid-century,[85][86] raising the
frequency of drought and food shortages (with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons, and thus
Indonesia's agriculture system[86]) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires.[86] Rising sea levels would also threaten most
of Indonesia's population, who live in low-lying coastal areas.[86][87][88] Impoverished communities would likely be affected
the most by climate change.[89]


Geology

                                         Tectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous
                                         volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.[90] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the
                                         Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate,
                                         where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes runs
                                         through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of
                                         Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi.[91] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are

Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of      Java.[92] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some
Fire area.                               areas.[93] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically
                                         sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali.[94]

A massive supervolcano erupted at present-day Lake Toba around 70,000 BCE. It is believed to have caused a global
volcanic winter and cooling of the climate and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution, though this is still
in debate.[95] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa were among the largest in recorded
history. The former caused 92,000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash that spread and blanketed parts of the
archipelago and made much of the Northern Hemisphere without summer in 1816.[96] The latter produced the loudest sound
in recorded history and caused 36,000 deaths due to the eruption itself and the resulting tsunamis, with significant additional
effects around the world years after the event.[97] Recent catastrophic disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 Indian
Ocean earthquake and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.


Biodiversity and conservation

Indonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it
is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and
Australasian species.[98][99] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia
and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and
leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long
separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and
fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of
Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]

Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its
515 species of mammal being endemic.[103] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline.
The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass
beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[12] Indonesia is one of the Coral Triangle countries
with the world's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[104]

British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line (Wallace Line) between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian
and Australasian species.[105] It runs roughly north–south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and
Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali. Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally
Asian, while east from Lombok is increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the Weber Line. In his 1869 book, The
Malay Archipelago, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[106] The region of islands between his line and
New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[105]

Indonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious
environmental issues. They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels
and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of
peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of
Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage
management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute
to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020
Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's
performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]             Deforestation in Riau province,

covered approximately 49.1% of the country's land area,[111] down from 87% in
1950.[112] Since the 1970s, log production, various plantations and agriculture have
been responsible for much of the deforestation in Indonesia.[112] Most recently, it has been driven by the palm oil
industry,[113] which has been criticised for its environmental impact and displacement of local communities.[110][114] The
situation has made Indonesia the world's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases.[115] It also threatens the survival of
indigenous and endemic species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of
mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan
rhinoceros.[118]

Government and politics
Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New
Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping
reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative
and judicial branches.[119] Chief among them is the delegation of power and
authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state.[120] The
President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-
chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI),
and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The
                                                                                             A presidential inauguration by the
president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[121]
                                                                                             MPR in the Parliament Complex

The highest representative body at the national level is the People's Consultative
Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat, MPR). Its main functions are
supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the
president,[122][123] and formalising broad outlines of state policy. The MPR comprises two houses; the People's
Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR), with 575 members, and the Regional Representative Council
(Dewan Perwakilan Daerah, DPD), with 136.[124] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Reforms
since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,[119] while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of
regional management.[125][123]

Most civil disputes appear before the State Court (Pengadilan Negeri); appeals are heard before the High Court (Pengadilan
Tinggi). The Supreme Court of Indonesia (Mahkamah Agung) is the highest level of the judicial branch and hears final
cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Constitutional Court (Mahkamah Konstitusi) which
listens to constitutional and political matters, and the Religious Court (Pengadilan Agama), which deals with codified Islamic
Personal Law (sharia) cases.[126] Additionally, the Judicial Commission (Komisi Yudisial) monitors the performance of
judges.[127]


Parties and elections

Since 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections
since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of
seats. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which secured the
most votes in the 2019 elections, is the party of the incumbent president, Joko
Widodo.[128] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups
(Golkar), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), the Democratic
Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).

resulted in nine political parties in the DPR, with a parliamentary threshold of
4% of the national vote.[129] At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a
president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR
and the non-partisan DPD.[124][119] Beginning with the 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have
occurred on the same date. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections would be held
simultaneously, starting in 2019.[130]


Administrative divisions

Indonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (Dewan Perwakilan
Rakyat Daerah, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in
1945,[131] with the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022.[132]
The second level are the regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota), led by regents (bupati) and mayors (walikota) respectively
and a legislature (DPRD Kabupaten/Kota). The third level are the districts (kecamatan, distrik in Papua, or kapanewon and
kemantren in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either desa, kelurahan, kampung, nagari in West Sumatra, or
gampong in Aceh).[133]

The village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (rukun warga, RW),
which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (rukun tetangga, RT). In Java, the village (desa) is divided into smaller
units called dusun or dukuh (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy
measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units responsible for providing most government
services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles village or neighbourhood
matters through an elected village head (lurah or kepala desa).[134]

Nine provinces—Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and
West Papua—are granted a special autonomous status (otonomi khusus) from the central government. A conservative Islamic
territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing sharia.[135] Jakarta is the
only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[136][137] Yogyakarta is the only pre-
colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for
the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[138] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones
where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[139]

Foreign relations

Indonesia maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad, including 95 embassies.[140]
The country adheres to what it calls a "free and active" foreign policy, seeking a role
in regional affairs in proportion to its size and location but avoiding involvement in
conflicts among other countries.[141]

Indonesia was a significant battleground during the Cold War. Numerous attempts by
the United States and the Soviet Union,[142][143] and China to some degree,[144]
culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a               Embassy of Indonesia, Canberra,
reorientation of foreign policy.[145] Quiet alignment with the Western world while      Australia
maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign policy since
then.[146] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding
member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit. In common with most of the
Muslim world, Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported Palestine. However,
observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[147]

Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[149] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free
Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a former member of OPEC.[150]
Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1967,[151][152] and recently, the country established
its first overseas aid programme in late 2019.[153]

Indonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air
Force (TNI–AU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of
GDP in 2018,[154] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations.[155] The Armed
Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal
militia. Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic
stability and deterring foreign threats.[156] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which
peaked during the New Order. Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the
legislature. Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level.[157]

Since independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[158]
Some, notably in Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and
brutality from all sides.[159][160][161] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[75] while the latter has continued amid a
significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and
human rights abuses as of 2006.[162] Other engagements of the army include the conflict against the Netherlands over the
Dutch New Guinea, the opposition to the British-sponsored creation of Malaysia ("Konfrontasi"), the mass killings of the
Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the invasion of East Timor, which remains Indonesia's most massive military
operation.[163][164]

Economy
Indonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play
vital roles.[166] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia,[167] the country has
the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country.
Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th
in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.392 trillion and US$4.398 trillion,
respectively. Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,855, while nominal per capita GDP is
US$5,016.[7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of
GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%).[168] Since 2009,
it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total
                                                                                               Vast palm oil plantation in Bogor

Over time, the structure of the economy has changed considerably.[170] Historically,
                                                                                               oil.[165]

development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote
agricultural self-sufficiency.[170] A gradual process of industrialisation and
urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling
oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports
and towards manufactured exports.[170] This development continued
throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price
shock, during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. As a result,
the official poverty rate fell from 60% to 15%.[171] Trade barriers
reduction from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally
integrated. The growth ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis that
severely impacted the economy, including a 13.1% real GDP contraction
in 1998 and a 78% inflation. The economy reached its low point in mid-            A proportional representation of Indonesia
1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.[172]                                         exports, 2019

Relatively steady inflation[173] and an increase in GDP deflator and the
Consumer Price Index[174] have contributed to strong economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2019, annual growth
accelerated to between 4% and 6% due to improvements in the banking sector and domestic consumption,[175] helping
Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession,[176] and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in
1997.[177] As of 2019, 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty line, and the official open unemployment rate was
5.28%.[178] During the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the economy suffered its first recession since the 1997
crisis but recovered in the following year.[179]

Indonesia has abundant natural resources. Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth,
tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans,
bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[180] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports,
with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary
imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States, Japan,
Singapore, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia's principal export markets and import partners.[181]


Transport




 Major transport modes in Indonesia. Clockwise from top: TransJakarta bus; KRL Commuterline; Garuda Indonesia Boeing 777–
                                                   300 ER; and Pelni ship.


Indonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution
of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java.[182] All transport modes play a role in the country's transport system
and are generally complementary rather than competitive. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[183]

The road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018.[184] Jakarta
has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-
corridor routes.[185] Rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as Angkot and Metromini are a regular sight in
the country.

Most railways are in Java, used for freight and passenger transport, such as local commuter rail services (mainly in Jakarta
and Yogyakarta–Solo) complementing the inter-city rail network in several cities. In the late 2010s, Jakarta and Palembang
were the first cities in Indonesia to have rapid transit systems, with more planned for other cities in the future.[186] In 2015,
the government announced a plan to build a high-speed rail, which would be the first in Southeast Asia.[187]

Indonesia's largest airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere, serving
54 million passengers in 2019. Ngurah Rai International Airport and Juanda International Airport are the country's second-
and third-busiest airport, respectively. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flag carrier since 1949, is one of the world's leading
airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam. The Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced
Indonesian port,[188] handling more than 50% of Indonesia's trans-shipment cargo traffic.



Energy

In 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059 quadrillion British thermal
units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043 quadrillion British thermal units)
worth of energy.[189] The country has substantial energy resources, including
22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of
which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of
coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.[190]

In late 2020, Indonesia's total national installed power generation capacity stands at
                                                                                            Sidrap wind farm, Indonesia's first
72,750.72 MW.[191] Although reliance on domestic coal and imported oil has                  wind power plant, in Sidrap Regency,
increased between 2010 and 2019,[189][192] Indonesia has seen progress in                   South Sulawesi
renewable energy, with hydropower and geothermal being the most abundant sources
that account for more than 8% in the country's energy mix.[189] A prime example of
the former is the country's largest dam, Jatiluhur, which has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW that feeds into the Java grid
managed by the State Electricity Company (Perusahaan Listrik Negara, PLN). Furthermore, Indonesia has the potential for
solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy,[193] although as of 2021, power generation from these sources remain small.


Science and technology

Government expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of
GDP in 2019),[194] and Indonesia only ranked 87th (out of 132 economies) on the
2021 Global Innovation Index report.[195] Historical examples of scientific and
technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique terasering,
which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar
people.[196] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a
road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in
several countries.[197] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and
freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry
(INKA), and has exported trains abroad.[198]

Indonesia has a long history of developing military and small commuter aircraft. It is Palapa satellite launch in 1984
the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft. The state-owned
Indonesian Aerospace company (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) has provided
components for Boeing and Airbus.[199] The company also collaborated with EADS CASA of Spain to develop the CN-
235, which has been used by several countries.[200] Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this
achievement.[201] Indonesia has also joined the South Korean programme to manufacture the 4.5-generation fighter jet KAI
KF-21 Boramae.[202]

Indonesia has a space programme and space agency, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (Lembaga Penerbangan
dan Antariksa Nasional, LAPAN). In the 1970s, Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system
called Palapa,[203] a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1, was launched on 8
July 1976 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.[204] As of 2019, Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for
various purposes.[205]


Tourism

                                            Tourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous
                                            year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors.[207] Overall, China, Singapore,
                                            Malaysia, Australia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to
                                            Indonesia.[208] Since 2011, Wonderful Indonesia has been the country's
                                            international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism.[209]

Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the
Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of the world's longest
coastlines, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999 mi). The ancient Borobudur and
Prambanan temples, as well as Toraja and Bali with their traditional festivities, are
some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.[211]                              Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua,
                                                                                         has the highest recorded level of

Indonesia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Komodo National Park and the Sawahlunto Coal Mine;
and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes Bunaken National Park and Raja Ampat Islands.[212] Other attractions include
specific points in Indonesian history, such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East Indies in the old towns of Jakarta and
Semarang and the royal palaces of Pagaruyung, Ubud, and Yogyakarta.[211]


Demographics
The 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest
in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%.[213] Java is
the world's most populous island,[214] where 56% of the country's population lives.[6]
The population density is 141 people per km2 (365 per sq mi),[6] ranking 88th in the
world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 (2,435 per sq
mi). In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people.[215]      Indonesia's ten metropolitan areas
It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050.[216]            labeled with their populations
The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of
30.2 years (2017 estimate).[77]

The spread of the population is uneven throughout the archipelago, with a varying habitats and levels of development,
ranging from the megacity of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in Papua.[217] As of 2017, about 54.7% of the population lives in
urban areas.[218] Jakarta is the country's primate city and the second-most populous urban area globally, with over 34 million
residents.[219] About 8 million Indonesians live overseas; most settled in Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan,
South Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia.[220]

Ethnic groups and languages

Indonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300
distinct native ethnic groups.[2] Most Indonesians are descended
from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-
Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan.
Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern
Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea and the
eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands).[23][221][222][223]
                                                                          A map of ethnic groups in Indonesia
The Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,[2] and are politically dominant.[224] They are
predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also in sizeable numbers in most provinces. The Sundanese
are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, Bugis and Malay people.[d] A sense
of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[225]

The country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, which had been the
archipelago's lingua franca for centuries. It was promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945
under the name Bahasa Indonesia.[226] Due to centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign
influences.[e] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics,
communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local
languages,[1] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan
languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[1] Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken[77] and has co-official status in
the Special Region of Yogyakarta.[230]

In 1930, Dutch and other Europeans (Totok), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of
the total population.[231] Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today. Also,
the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350
years.[232] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic
groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was
commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[233] Today, there is some degree of fluency
by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[234] as specific law codes are still only available in
Dutch.[235]


Religion

Despite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[236][123] the government officially recognises only six religions:
Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[237][238] with indigenous religions only
partly acknowledged.[238] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-
majority country,[239][240] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[241] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1%
(1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[238][242] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the
majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[243] Most Hindus are Balinese,[244] and most Buddhists are Chinese
Indonesians.[245]

                                         The natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous animism
                                         and dynamism, beliefs that are common to Austronesian peoples.[246] They
                                         worshipped and revered ancestral spirit and believed that supernatural spirits (hyang)
                                         might inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or sacred
                                         sites.[246] Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese Sunda
                                         Wiwitan, Dayak's Kaharingan, and the Javanese Kejawèn. They have significantly
                                         impacted how other faiths are practised, evidenced by a large proportion of people—
                                         such as the Javanese abangan, Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christians—practising a

Temple in Bali, the only Indonesian
province where Hinduism is the
                                         Hindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE.[248] The
predominant religion                     Sundanese Kingdom of Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first
                                         historically recorded Indianised kingdom in the archipelago.[249] Buddhism arrived
                                         around the 6th century,[250] and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of
Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhism had their roots around the same period. The archipelago has witnessed the
rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit, Sailendra, Srivijaya, and Mataram.
Though no longer a majority, Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture.[251][252]

Islam was introduced by Sunni traders of the Shafi'i school as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern
Arabia as early as the 8th century CE.[253][254] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and
religious influences, resulting in a distinct form of Islam (santri).[33][255] Trade, Islamic missionary activity such as by the
Wali Sanga and Chinese explorer Zheng He, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of
Islam.[256][257] By the end of the 16th century, it had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java
and Sumatra.

                                      traders and missionaries such as Jesuit Francis

                                      thousand locals.[258][259] Its spread faced

multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country.[263]

There was a sizeable Jewish presence in the archipelago until 1945, mostly Dutch
and some Baghdadi Jews. Since most left after Indonesia proclaimed independence, Judaism was never accorded official
status, and only a tiny number of Jews remain today, mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya.[264]

At the national and local level, Indonesia's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith
relations, both positively and negatively. The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation,
Pancasila[265][266] (i.e. the belief in the one and only God), often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance,[267] though
instances of intolerance have occurred.[268][74] An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential
and an integral part of life.[269][270]


Education and health

Education is compulsory for 12 years.[271] Parents can choose between state-run,
non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools,
supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[272] Private
international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The
enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36%
for tertiary education (2018).[273] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the
government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[273] In 2018, there
were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in           Bandung Institute of Technology in
Sumatra and Java.[274][275] According to the QS World University Rankings,                    West Java
Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University
and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[276]

Government expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016.[277] As part of an attempt to achieve universal
health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN) in 2014.[278] It
includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme. Despite
remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in
2019)[279] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019),[280] challenges
remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases.[281]


Issues

In the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health
between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java)
and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua).[282][283]
This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in
the western parts of the archipelago[284] and yet grows slower than the rest of the
country.
                                                                                              Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14
In the social arena, numerous cases of racism and discrimination, especially against    May 1998
Chinese Indonesians and Papuans, have been well documented throughout
Indonesia's history.[285][286] Such cases have sometimes led to violent conflicts, most
notably the May 1998 riots and the Papua conflict, which has continued since 1962. LGBT people also regularly face
challenges. Although LGBT issues have been relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of
anti-LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation, discrimination, and even
violence.[287][288] In addition, Indonesia has been reported to have sizeable numbers of child and forced labourers, with the
former being prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing industry.[289][290]

Culture
The cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia. Influences from the Indian subcontinent,
mainland China, the Middle East, Europe,[291][292] Melanesian and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the
cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago. As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural,
multilingual and multi-ethnic society,[1][2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original
indigenous cultures. Indonesia currently holds twelve items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang
puppet theatre, kris, batik,[293] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance.[294]


Art and architecture

                                        Indonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and
                                        recently developed contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity,
                                        Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab
                                        world, China and Europe, due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often
                                        motivated by trade.[295] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its
                                        people are famed for their artistry. Their painting tradition started as classical
                                        Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on
                                        candi bas reliefs in eastern Java.[296]
Traditional Balinese painting
depicting cockfighting                  There have been numerous discoveries of
                                        megalithic sculptures in Indonesia.[297]
                                        Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within
the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak and Toraja.[298][299] Wood and stone are
common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the
8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation developed refined stone sculpting art
and architecture influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. The temples
of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the
practice.[300]                                                                             An avenue of Tongkonan houses in a
                                                                                           Torajan village, South Sulawesi
As with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have
brought cultural changes and profound effects on building styles and techniques. The
most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant.
Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with
numbers of traditional houses' (rumah adat) styles that have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements vary by
ethnic group, and each has a specific custom and history.[301] Examples include Toraja's Tongkonan, Minangkabau's Rumah
Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay houses,
Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of rice barns (lumbung).


Music, dance and clothing

The music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by
musical instruments in their rituals. Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples
of traditional Indonesian instruments. The diverse world of Indonesian music genres results from the musical creativity of its
people and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences. These include gambus and qasida from the Middle
East,[302] keroncong from Portugal,[303] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with notable Hindi
influence as well as Malay orchestras.[304] Today, the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional
popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei,[305][306] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between
Indonesian and Malay.[307]

                                               and Balinese Pendet dance.


Indonesian dances have a diverse history, with more than 3,000 original dances. Scholars
believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[308] Examples include
war dances, a dance of witch doctors, and a dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals
such as Hudoq. Indonesian dances derive their influences from the archipelago's prehistoric
and tribal, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic periods. Recently, modern dances and urban teen
dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture and those of Japan and
South Korea to some extent. However, various traditional dances, including those of Java,
Bali and Dayak, remain a living and dynamic tradition.[309]

Indonesia has various clothing styles due to its long and rich cultural history. The national
costume originates from the country's indigenous culture and traditional textile traditions. The
Javanese Batik and Kebaya[310] are arguably Indonesia's most recognised national costumes,
though they have Sundanese and Balinese origins as well.[311] Each province has a
representation of traditional attire and dress,[291] such as Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra;
Songket of Malay and Minangkabau from Sumatra; and Ikat of Sasak from Lombok. People                Cotton wikkelrok with batik
wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings, formal ceremonies, music           geometric pattern
performances, government and official occasions,[311] and they vary from traditional to
modern attire.


Theatre and cinema

                                       Wayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre display
                                       several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata.[312] Other forms
                                       of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara,
                                       Betawi Lenong,[313][314] and various Balinese dance dramas. They incorporate
                                       humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances.[315] Some theatre
                                       traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the
 Pandava and Krishna in an act of the  Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. It is usually performed for traditional
 Wayang Wong performance               ceremonies and festivals[316][317] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends
                                       and love story.[317] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its
                                       distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as Teater
Koma are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society.[318]

The first film produced in the archipelago was Loetoeng Kasaroeng,[319] a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. The
film industry expanded after independence, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. Usmar Ismail, who made
significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s, is generally considered the pioneer of Indonesian films.[320] The latter part of the
Sukarno era saw the use of cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes, and foreign films were subsequently banned,
while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order.[321] Production of films peaked during
the 1980s, although it declined significantly in the next decade.[319] Notable films in this period include Pengabdi Setan
(1980), Nagabonar (1987), Tjoet Nja' Dhien (1988), Catatan Si Boy (1989), and Warkop's comedy films.
Independent filmmaking was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998, when films started
addressing previously banned topics, such as religion, race, and love.[321] Between 2000 and
2005, the number of films released each year steadily increased.[322] Riri Riza and Mira
Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed Kuldesak (1999),
Petualangan Sherina (2000), Ada Apa dengan Cinta? (2002), and Laskar Pelangi (2008). In
2022, KKN di Desa Penari smashed box office records, becoming the most-watched
Indonesian film with 9.2 million tickets sold.[323] Indonesia has held annual film festivals and
awards, including the Indonesian Film Festival (Festival Film Indonesia) held intermittently
since 1955. It hands out the Citra Award, the film industry's most prestigious award. From
1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued until its revival in 2004.


Mass media and literature                                                                          Advertisement for Loetoeng

                                        Media freedom increased considerably after the fall of     fiction film produced in the
                                        the New Order, during which the Ministry of                Dutch East Indies
                                        Information monitored and controlled domestic media
                                        and restricted foreign media.[324] The television
                                        market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that
                                        compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962
                                        to 1989. By the early 21st century, the improved communications system had brought
                                        television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11

                                         Like other developing countries, Indonesia began developing Internet in the early
1990s. Its first commercial Internet service provider, PT. Indo Internet began operation in Jakarta in 1994.[326] The country
had 171 million Internet users in 2018, with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually.[327] Most are between the ages
of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on mobile phones for access, outnumbering laptops and computers.[328]

The oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of Sanskrit
inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia's peoples have firmly rooted oral
traditions, which help define and preserve their cultural identities.[330] In written poetry and
prose, several traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, hikayat and babad.
Examples of these forms include Syair Abdul Muluk, Hikayat Hang Tuah, Sulalatus Salatin,
and Babad Tanah Jawi.[331]

Early modern Indonesian literature originates in the Sumatran tradition.[332][333] Literature
and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence. Balai
Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted in 1917 to promote the
development of indigenous literature. Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the
Golden Age of Indonesian Literature.[334] The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian
                                                                                                   Pramoedya Ananta Toer,

                                                                                                   Literature.[329]

Cuisine

Indonesian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse, vibrant, and colourful, full of intense flavour.[336] Many regional
cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and
Indian precedents.[337] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably
chilli), coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[338]

Some popular dishes such as nasi goreng, gado-gado, sate, and soto are ubiquitous and considered national dishes. The
Ministry of Tourism, however, chose tumpeng as the official national dish in 2014, describing it as binding the diversity of
various culinary traditions.[339] Other popular dishes include rendang, one of the many Padang cuisines along with dendeng
                                        and gulai. Another fermented food is oncom, similar in some ways to tempeh but
                                        uses a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and is prevalent in
                                        West Java.[340]

Sports

Badminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia. Indonesia is among the few
countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's
and women's badminton. Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to
Indonesia's Olympic medal tally. Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league. On the
international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in
1938 as the Dutch East Indies.[341] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the
1958 Asian Games as well as two gold medals at the 1987 and 1991 Southeast Asian Games
(SEA Games). Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 and
successfully qualified for a total of five tournaments, although they never make the knockout
phase.[342]

Other popular sports include boxing and basketball, which has a long history in Indonesia
                                                                                                A demonstration of Pencak

Sepak takraw and karapan sapi (bull racing) in Madura are some examples of Indonesia's
traditional sports. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held,
such as caci in Flores and pasola in Sumba. Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art and, in 1987, became one of the
sporting events in the SEA Games, with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia
is one of the top sports powerhouses by topping the SEA Games medal table ten times since 1977,[344] most recently in
2011.[345]
