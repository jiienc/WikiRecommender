Komodo dragon
The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as
the Komodo monitor, is a member of the monitor lizard family
Varanidae that is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo,
Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. It is the largest extant species of
lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 m (9.8 ft), and
weighing up to 70 kg (150 lb).
As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators,
and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo
dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds,
and mammals. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is
exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons
mainly consists of Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), though they also
eat considerable amounts of carrion. Komodo dragons also
occasionally attack humans.
Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in
September; as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an
abandoned megapode nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The
eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April,
when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are
vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such as
cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are
estimated to live up to 30 years.
Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in
1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them
popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has contracted due
to human activities, and is likely to contract further from the
effects of climate change; due to this, they are listed as
Endangered by the IUCN Red List. They are protected under
Indonesian law, and Komodo National Park was founded in
1980 to aid protection efforts.

Taxonomic history
Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910,
when rumors of a "land crocodile" reached Lieutenant van Steyn
van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration.[5]
Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when Peter Ouwens, the

paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the
lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector.[4]
The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were
exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in
1927.[6] Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest
observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated
their behaviour at a Scientific Meeting of the Zoological Society
of London in 1928.[7]
The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to
Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning
with 12 preserved specimens and two live ones, this expedition
provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie King Kong.[8] It was
also Burden who coined the common name "Komodo dragon".[9]
Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the
American Museum of Natural History.[10]

The Dutch island administration, realizing the limited number of
individuals in the wild, soon outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for
scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming
until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction,
and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the
Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on
Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra
Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons.[11]
Research from the Auffenberg expedition proved enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in
captivity.[12] Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo
dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.[13]

Etymology
The Komodo dragon is also sometimes known as the Komodo
monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature,[14]
although this name is uncommon. To the natives of Komodo
Island, it is referred to as ora, buaya darat ('land crocodile'), or
biawak raksasa ('giant monitor').[15][5]

Evolutionary history
The evolutionary development of the Komodo dragon started with
the genus Varanus, which originated in Asia about 40 million years
ago and migrated to Australia, where it evolved into giant forms
(the largest of all being the recently extinct Varanus priscus, or
"Megalania"), helped by the absence of competing placental
carnivorans. Around 15 million years ago, a collision between the

continental landmasses of Australia and Southeast Asia allowed these larger varanids to move back into
what is now the Indonesian archipelago, extending their range as far east as the island of Timor.
The Komodo dragon is believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors about 4 million years
ago. However, fossil evidence from Queensland suggests the Komodo dragon actually evolved in
Australia, before spreading to Indonesia.[1][16] The oldest records of the Komodo dragon on Flores date to
over 1.3 million years ago.[17]
Dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental
shelf that the Komodo dragon colonised, becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose
afterwards.[1][5] Fossils of extinct Pliocene species of similar size to the modern Komodo dragon, such as
Varanus sivalensis, have been found in Eurasia as well, indicating that they fared well even in
environments containing competition, such as mammalian carnivores, until the climate change and
extinction events that marked the beginning of the Pleistocene.[1]
Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows the Komodo dragon to be the closest relative (sister taxon)
of the lace monitor (V. varius), with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that gave rise to the
crocodile monitor (Varanus salvadorii) of New Guinea.[18][19][20] A 2021 study showed that during the
Miocene, Komodo dragons had hybridized with the ancestors of the Australian sand monitor (V. gouldii),
thus providing further evidence that the Komodo dragon had once inhabited Australia.[21][22][23] Genetic
analysis indicates that the population from northern Flores is genetically distinct from other populations of
the species.[2]With the Komodo's similarities to extinct species of large lizards, their teeth has been used to
date and predict the size of theropod dinosaurs. [24]

Description
In the wild, adult Komodo dragons usually weigh around 70 kg
(150 lb), although captive specimens often weigh more.[25]
According to Guinness World Records, an average adult male will
weigh 79 to 91 kg (174 to 201 lb) and measure 2.59 m (8.5 ft),
while an average female will weigh 68 to 73 kg (150 to 161 lb) and
Specimen in profile
measure 2.29 m (7.5 ft).[26] The largest verified specimen in
captive was 3.13 m (10.3 ft) long and weighed 166 kg (366 lb),
including its undigested food.[5] The largest wild specimen had a
length 3.04 m (10.0 ft), a snout-vent length (SVL) 1.54 m (5 ft 1 in) and a mass of 81.5 kg (180 lb)
excluding stomach contents.[27][28] The heaviest reached a mass in 87.4 kg (193 lb).[27] The study noted
that weights greater than 100 kg (220 lb) were possible but only after the animal had consumed a large
meal.[27][28]
The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about
60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to 2.5 cm
(1 in) in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged because its
teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is
naturally lacerated during feeding.[29] It also has a long, yellow,
deeply forked tongue.[5] Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by
armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that
function as a sort of natural chain-mail.[30][31] The only areas
lacking osteoderms on the head of the adult Komodo dragon are
around the eyes, nostrils, mouth margins, and pineal eye, a lightsensing organ on the top of the head. Where lizards typically have
one or two varying patterns or shapes of osteoderms, komodos

have four: rosette, platy, dendritic, and vermiform.[32] This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor
source of leather. Additionally, these osteoderms become more extensive and variable in shape as the
Komodo dragon ages, ossifying more extensively as the lizard grows. These osteoderms are absent in
hatchlings and juveniles, indicating that the natural armor develops as a product of age and competition
between adults for protection in intraspecific combat over food and mates.[33]

Senses

seen.[35]

As with other varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear
bone, the stapes, for transferring vibrations from the tympanic
membrane to the cochlea. This arrangement means they are likely
restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 hertz range, compared to
humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz.[5][34] They were
formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in
wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or
shouts. This was disputed when London Zoological Garden
employee Joan Procter trained a captive specimen to come out to
feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be

The Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as 300 m (980 ft), but because its retinas only contain
cones, it is thought to have poor night vision. It can distinguish colours, but has poor visual discrimination
of stationary objects.[36]
As with many other reptiles, the Komodo dragon primarily relies on its tongue to detect, taste, and smell
stimuli, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson's organ, rather than using the nostrils.[37] With the
help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon
may be able to detect carrion from 4–9.5 km (2.5–5.9 mi) away.[36] It only has a few taste buds in the back
of its throat.[37] Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to
nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have
three or more sensory plaques.[29]

Behaviour and ecology
The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places and typically lives
in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low
elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it
exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary,
coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running
rapidly in brief sprints up to 20 km/h (12 mph), diving up to 4.5 m
(15 ft), and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of
their strong claws.[25] To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo
dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support.[35]
As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great
size makes climbing impractical.[29]

Male komodo dragons fighting

For shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from 1 to 3 m (3.3 to 9.8 ft) wide with its
powerful forelimbs and claws.[38] Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able
to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after.[39] The

Komodo dragon hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day.[9] These
special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are
cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer.[40]

Diet
Komodo dragons are apex predators.[41] They are carnivores;
although they have been considered as eating mostly carrion,[42]
they will frequently ambush live prey with a stealthy approach.
When suitable prey arrives near a dragon's ambush site, it will
suddenly charge at the animal at high speeds and go for the
underside or the throat.[29]
Komodo dragons do not deliberately allow the prey to escape with
Komodo dragon on Rinca feeding on
fatal injuries but try to kill prey outright using a combination of
a water buffalo corpse
lacerating damage and blood loss. They have been recorded as
killing wild pigs within seconds,[43] and observations of Komodo
dragons tracking prey for long distances are likely misinterpreted cases of prey escaping an attack before
succumbing to infection.
Komodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the
carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws,
flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The undigested vegetable
contents of a prey animal's stomach and intestines are typically avoided.[40] Copious amounts of red saliva
the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (15–
20 minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the
carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully that the tree is knocked
down.[40] A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while
swallowing.[29]
After eating up to 80% of its body weight in one meal,[41] it drags itself to a sunny location to speed
digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested in its stomach for too long. Because
of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year.[29] After digestion, the
Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered
in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid
of the mucus.[29]
The eating habits of Komodo dragons follow a hierarchy, with the larger animals generally eating before
the smaller ones. The largest male typically asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their
submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to "wrestling".
Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors.[44][45]
The Komodo dragon's diet is wide-ranging, and includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller
Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boar, goats, pigs,[46] deer, horses, and
water buffalo.[47] Young Komodos will eat insects, eggs, geckos, and small mammals, while adults prefer
to hunt large mammals.[42] Occasionally, they attack and bite humans. Sometimes they consume human
corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves.[35] This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of
Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground, and pile rocks on top of them, to deter the

lizards.[40] The Komodo dragon may have evolved to feed on the extinct
dwarf species of Stegodon (a member of Proboscidea related to elephants)
that once lived on Flores, according to evolutionary biologist Jared
Diamond.[48]
The Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal
pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the
water run down its throat.[43]

Saliva
Although previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a

variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey,[44][49]

Komodo dragons have good mouth hygiene. To quote Bryan Fry: "After

they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and
digestion process
rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth ... Unlike people have
been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their
meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria." Nor do Komodo dragons wait for prey to die and track it at a
distance, as vipers do; observations of them hunting deer, boar and in some cases buffalo reveal that they
kill prey in less than half an hour.[50]
The observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos,
who are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water after escaping an attack.
The warm, faeces-filled water would then cause the infections. The study used samples from 16 captive
dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three US zoos.[50]

Antibacterial immune factor
Researchers have isolated a powerful antibacterial peptide from the blood plasma of Komodo dragons,
VK25. Based on their analysis of this peptide, they have synthesized a short peptide dubbed DRGN-1 and
tested it against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Preliminary results of these tests show that DRGN-1
is effective in killing drug-resistant bacterial strains and even some fungi. It has the added observed benefit
of significantly promoting wound healing in both uninfected and mixed biofilm infected wounds.[51]

Venom

deer

In late 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated
the perentie (Varanus giganteus), other species of monitors, and
agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes the
immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild
envenomation. Bites on human digits by a lace monitor (V. varius),
a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (V. scalaris) all
produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of
blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some
symptoms lasting for several hours.[52]

In 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating Komodo dragons possess a
venomous bite. MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw. The
researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the Singapore
Zoological Gardens, and found it secreted several different toxic proteins. The known functions of these
proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction
of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey.[53][54] As a result of the
discovery, the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was
disputed.[55]
Other scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands "has had the effect of underestimating the
variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view
of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution." According to these scientists
"reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey." These
researchers concluded that, "Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does
not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate
biochemical systems."[56] Evolutionary biologist Schwenk says that even if the lizards have venom-like
proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary
to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary
factors.[57][58]

Reproduction
Mating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in
September.[5][59] During this period, males fight over females and
territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with
the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may
vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight.[35] The winner of
the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain
information about her receptivity.[41] Females are antagonistic and
resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of
courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during
Komodo dragons mating
coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males
rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and
licking.[60] Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female's cloaca.[36]
Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form "pair bonds", a rare behavior for lizards.[35]
Female Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality; in one
study, 60% laid their eggs in the nests of orange-footed scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or megapode), 20% on
ground level and 20% in hilly areas.[61] The females make many camouflage nests/holes to prevent other
dragons from eating the eggs.[62] Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period
of 7–8 months.[35] Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells
with an egg tooth that falls off before long. After cutting themselves out, the hatchlings may lie in their
eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable
to predation.[44] Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46.5 cm long and weighed
105.1 grams.[61]
Young Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from
predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets.[35] The habit of
cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands

is rare.[63] When the young approach a kill, they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of
eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults.[35] Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to
mature, and may live for up to 30 years.[59]
Parthenogenesis
A Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of
eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for
more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able
to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an adaptation
known as superfecundation.[64] On 20 December 2006, it was
reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester
Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have
laid unfertilised eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched,
all of them male.[65] Scientists at Liverpool University in England
Parthenogenetic baby Komodo
performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being
dragon, Chester Zoo, England
moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in
physical contact with a male dragon. After Flora's eggs' condition
had been discovered, testing showed Sungai's eggs were also produced without outside fertilization.[66] On
31 January 2008, the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, became the first zoo in the Americas to
document parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons. The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons, one of
which laid about 17 eggs on 19–20 May 2007. Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space
issues; the first hatched on 31 January 2008, while the second hatched on 1 February. Both hatchlings were
males.[67][68]
Komodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex-determination system, as opposed to the mammalian XY
system. Male progeny prove Flora's unfertilized eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later
to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilized by a polar body, or by chromosome duplication without cell
division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries
failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she
provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only
one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops
parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome
become WW and fail to develop,[69][70] meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this
species.
It has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated
ecological niche (such as an island) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a
sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and
female young).[69] Despite the advantages of such an adaptation, zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis
may be detrimental to genetic diversity.[71]

Encounters with humans

Attacks on humans are rare, but Komodo dragons have been
responsible for several human fatalities, in both the wild and in
captivity. According to data from Komodo National Park spanning
a 38-year period between 1974 and 2012, there were 24 reported
attacks on humans, five of them fatal. Most of the victims were
local villagers living around the national park.[72]

Conservation
Humans handling a komodo dragon

The Komodo dragon is classified by the IUCN as Endangered and
is listed on the IUCN Red List.[2] The species' sensitivity to natural
and man-made threats has long been recognized by conservationists,
zoological societies, and the Indonesian government. Komodo National
Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on
islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar.[73] Later, the Wae Wuul and
Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid Komodo dragon
conservation.[13]

Komodo dragons generally avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are
very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than
about 100 metres (330 ft). Older animals will also retreat from humans from
a shorter distance away. If cornered, they may react aggressively by gaping
their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further,
they may attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked
Komodo dragons on Rinca
Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are
either not reputable or have subsequently been interpreted as defensive
bites. Only very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by atypical individuals who lost their
fear of humans.[44]
Volcanic activity, earthquakes, loss of habitat, fire,[29][13] tourism, loss of prey due to poaching, and illegal
poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon. A
major future threat to the species is climate change via both aridification and sea level rise, which can affect
the low-lying habitats and valleys that the Komodo dragon depends on, as Komodo dragons do not range
into the higher-altitude regions of the islands they inhabit. Based on projections, climate change will lead to
a decline in suitable habitat of 8.4%, 30.2%, or 71% by 2050 depending on the climate change scenario.
Without effective conservation actions, populations on Flores are extirpated in all scenarios, while in the
more extreme scenarios, only the populations on Komodo and Rinca persist in highly reduced numbers.
Rapid climate change mitigation is crucial for conserving the species in the wild.[2][74] Other scientists have
disputed the conclusions about the effects of climate change on Komodo dragon populations.[75]
Under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), commercial
international trade of Komodo dragon skins or specimens is prohibited.[76][77] Despite this, there are
occasional reports of illegal attempts to trade in live Komodo dragons. The most recent attempt was in
March 2019, when Indonesian police in the East Java city of Surabaya reported that a criminal network had
been caught trying to smuggle 41 young Komodo dragons out of Indonesia. The plan was said to include
shipping the animals to several other countries in Southeast Asia through Singapore. It was hoped that the
animals could be sold for up to 500 million rupiah (around US$35,000) each.[78] It was believed that the
Komodo dragons had been smuggled out of East Nusa Tenggara province through the port at Ende in
central Flores.[79]

In 2013, the total population of Komodo dragons in the wild was assessed as 3,222 individuals, declining
to 3,092 in 2014 and 3,014 in 2015. Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands (Komodo
and Rinca), but decreased on smaller islands, such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang, likely due to
diminishing prey availability.[80] On Padar, a former population of Komodo dragons has recently become
extinct, of which the last individuals were seen in 1975.[81] It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon
died out on Padar following a major decline of populations of large ungulate prey, for which poaching was
most likely responsible.[82]

In captivity
Komodo dragons have long been sought-after zoo attractions,
where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They
are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection
and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily
reproduce in captivity.[15] The first Komodo dragons were
displayed at London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was

exhibited in 1934 in the United States at the National Zoo in

Washington, D.C., but it lived for only two years. More attempts to
exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of the animals
proved very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological
Park. Studies were done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book The Behavioral
Ecology of the Komodo Monitor, eventually allowed for more successful management and breeding of the
dragons in captivity.[12] As of May 2009, there were 35 North American, 13 European, one Singaporean,
two African, and two Australian institutions which housed captive Komodo dragons.[83]
A variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals become relatively
tame within a short time,[84][85] and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating
between familiar and unfamiliar keepers.[86] Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play
with a variety of objects, including shovels, cans, plastic rings, and shoes. This behavior does not seem to
be "food-motivated predatory behavior".[41][5][87]
Even seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive, especially when the animal's
territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil
Bronstein, the then-husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo
after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take
off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they
were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon.[88][89] Although he survived, Bronstein
needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.[90]
