Rendang
Rendang

(/ˈrəndɑːŋ/
REN-DUNG;
Indonesian
pronunciation: [rənˈdaŋ]) is a Minang dish originating from the
Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia.[5] It has
spread across Indonesian cuisine to the cuisines of
neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines.[2] Rendang is often
described as a rich dish of meat — most commonly beef
(rendang daging) — that has been slow cooked and braised in
a coconut milk seasoned with a herb and spice mixture,[6][7]
until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown and
tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich flavours.
As the signature dish of Minangkabau culture, rendang is
traditionally served at ceremonial occasions to honour guests
during festive events; such as wedding feasts and Lebaran or
Hari Raya (Indonesian popular words for both Eid al-Fitr and
Eid al-Adha).[8] Rendang is also traditionally served among the
Malay community in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
Brunei, as well as the Maranao in the Philippines.[9]
Rendang is officially recognised as one of Indonesia's national
dishes. Six types of rendang preparations have also been
designated as intangible cultural heritage by the Indonesian
Ministry of Education and Culture. A broad survey in 2011
placed beef rendang as the most delicious dish in the world.[10]

The origin of rendang could be traced back to the Indian merchants links to West Sumatra before the 15th
century. There are Dutch archives about Minangkabau that state regular contacts between India and West
Sumatra in the early second millennium, thus suggests that north Indian curry was possibly the precursor of
rendang. Indian curry was adopted by the Minangkabau people as gulai, a local version of curry.
Minangkabau people then cooked this gulai further in order to prepare kalio also known as wet rendang.
This cooking process was then continued until it thickened and became rendang or also known as dry
rendang.[11]
Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region
when Minangkabau merchants began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century, "Because the
journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is
suitable for a long journey."[12] The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks,
even when left at room temperature.[13] One of the earliest written records of rendang is from the Malaccan
Malay manuscript of Hikayat Amir Hamzah,[14] Rendang originated in the Sumatran Minangkabau region
and the making of rendang spreads from Minangkabau highlands to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the
strait to Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions.[15]
During Indonesian National Revolution in 1946, Indonesian first lady Fatmawati, the wife of Sukarno
cooked and sent rendang to boost morale of Indonesian republic freedom fighters around Yogyakarta.
Declined by household helps, she insisted on buying beef and went to the market herself by becak despite
being pregnant at that time.[16]
The popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the merantau (migrating)
culture of Minangkabau people. In the modern era, Overseas Minangkabau leave their hometown to start a
career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighboring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau
eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have
introduced and popularised Minangkabau style rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.

Cultural significance
Rendang is revered in Minangkabau culture as an embodiment of
the philosophy of musyawarah, discussion and consultation with
elders.[17] It has been claimed that the four main ingredients
represent Minangkabau society as a whole:[18][19]
1. The meat (daging) symbolises the Niniak Mamak, the
traditional clan leaders such as the datuk, the nobles,
royalty and revered elders.
Rendang is a dish delivered to elders
2. The coconut milk (karambia) symbolises the Cadiak
during traditional Minangkabau
Pandai, intellectuals, teachers, poets and writers.
ceremonies.
3. The chilli (lado) symbolises the Alim Ulama, clerics,
ulama and religious leaders. The hotness of the chilli
symbolises Sharia.
4. The spice mixture (pemasak) symbolises the rest of Minangkabau society.
In Minangkabau tradition, rendang is a requisite dish for special occasions in traditional Minang
ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to circumcision, marriage, Qur'an recitals, and religious festivals such as
Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.[20]

In 2011, rendang placed 11th place on a list of World's 50 best foods published by CNN International.[21]
An online reader's poll of 35,000 voters chose beef rendang as the top dish on CNN International's
Readers' picks list.[10]
The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture have included six rendang preparations under its
National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia list, all of which are registered under West Sumatra:
Randang (Minang spelling),[22] and gulai rendang,[23] were part of the inaugural list in 2010. They were
joined by randang daging (meat rendang),[24] randang kantang (potato rendang),[25] and randang incek
kacang,[26] in 2016. Rendang paku (fern rendang) of Dharmasraya, is the most recent addition as of
2018.[27]
In 2018, rendang was officially recognised by the Indonesian government as one of the country's five
national dishes: the others are soto, sate, nasi goreng, and gado-gado.[28]

Composition and cooking method

A rendang cooking festival in West
Sumatra

Rendang is most often described as meat slow-cooked in coconut
milk and spices until it becomes tender.[29][7] If cooked properly,
dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks.[13] Prior to
refrigeration technology, this style of cooking enabled preservation
of the large amount of meat.[30] The cooking technique flourished
because of its role in preserving meat in a tropical climate.[12] Its
durability is one of the reasons that today, prepackaged rendang is
sent as food aid relief for natural disaster survivors in Indonesia.[7]
The cut of beef suitable for rendang is lean meat of the rear leg of
the cattle; i.e. topside or round beef, which is considered perfect for
slow cooking.[31]

Rendang is rich in spices. Along with the main meat ingredient, rendang uses coconut milk and a paste of
mixed ground spices, including ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillis and
other spices. This spice mixture is called pemasak in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger and
galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives.[32]
Although some culinary experts describe rendang as a curry,[29][5][13] the dish is usually not considered as
such in Indonesia or Malaysia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for curries.[33]
Traditionally the term rendang does not refer to a certain type of dish. The verb merendang actually refers
to a method of slow cooking; continuously churning the ingredients in a pot or frying pan, on a small fire,
until all of the liquids evaporate and the meat is well done.[34] Traditional Padang rendang takes hours to
cook. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is
time-consuming and requires patience.[35] The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices
until almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to become tender and absorb the condiments. The
cooking process changes from boiling to frying, as the liquid evaporates and the coconut milk turns to
coconut oil.[36] Cooking the meat until tender with almost all the liquid evaporated requires great care,
keeping it from getting burnt. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having
a complex and unique taste.
Rendang is often served with steamed rice, ketupat (a compressed rice cake) or lemang (glutinous rice
cooked in bamboo tubes), accompanied with vegetable side dishes such as boiled cassava leaf, cubadak[37]
(young jackfruit gulai), cabbage gulai and lado (red or green chilli pepper sambal).

Types
In Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages
in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is
categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut
milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry:
Gulai — Kalio – Rendang.[38] The ingredients of gulai, kalio and
rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that gulai usually
has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has
richer spices.

continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat
has started to brown, the dish is called kalio. For traditional dry
rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid
has all but completely evaporated and the color turns to a dark brown, almost black color. Thus not only

liquid content but also color indicate which type of rendang is involved: gulai is light yellow, kalio is brown
and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry
or wet.

Dry rendang
According to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry
one. Although, unlike crispy dendeng balado spicy jerky, rendang's
texture is not actually dry, since it is quite moist and rather oily.
Rendang is diligently stirred, attended, and cooked for hours until
the coconut milk has evaporated, turned into coconut oil, and the
meat has absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial
occasions or to honor guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can
last for three to four weeks stored at room temperature and is still
good to consume.[13] It can even last months stored in a
refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.

Wet rendang or kalio
Wet rendang, more accurately identified as kalio, is a type of
rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the
coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. Kalio has quite abundant
liquid sauce acquired from cooked coconut milk that partly has
turned into spicy oil, which is quite flavourful if consumed with
steamed rice. Much of rendang served abroad is actually more akin
to kalio or wet version of rendang. If stored at room temperature,
kalio lasts less than a week.[8] Kalio usually has a light golden
brown colour, paler than dry rendang.

Variations

Most rendang in the Netherlands is
actually a kalio because it still
contains some liquid

Rendang is made from beef (or occasionally beef liver, chicken,
duck, mutton, water buffalo, or vegetables like jackfruit or cassava). Chicken or duck rendang also contains
tamarind and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.[39]
The original Minangkabau rendang has two categories, rendang darek and rendang pesisir. Rendang darek
(‘land rendang’) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of the Minangkabau
Highlands such as Batusangkar, Agam, Lima Puluh Kota, Payakumbuh, Padang Panjang and Bukittinggi.
It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products
which are found in these places. Rendang pesisir (‘coastal rendang’) is from the coastal regions of
Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman. Rendang pesisir mainly consists of seafood,
although it is not unusual for them to incorporate beef or water buffalo meat in their rendang.

Today, rendang is quite widespread in Indonesia, owned mainly by the proliferation of Padang restaurants
in the country, which led to popularity and adoption of rendang into the kitchens of contemporary
Indonesian households of various ethnic backgrounds. This might led to development of variants with
slightly altered tastes to accommodate regional preferences. Other ethnic groups in Indonesia also have
adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang—aside from the
Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants—tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate
Javanese tastes.

southern Philippines as well as in the Netherlands, Australia and Belgium.[3][9]

In the Netherlands
The Dutch are familiar with rendang through colonial ties and often serve the wet kalio version in the
Netherlands—usually as part of a rijsttafel. Indonesian dishes, including rendang, are served in numbers of
Indonesian restaurants in Dutch cities, especially The Hague, Utrecht, Rotterdam and Amsterdam.[112]

In the Philippines
In the Philippines, rendang is most commonly associated with the cuisine of the Muslim Maranao people of
Mindanao. It differs from the Indonesian versions in the use of the native spice mix palapa as well as the
addition of muscovado sugar.[113][114][115]

Fusion rendang
Rendang bumbu is sometimes used as the base of other fusion
dishes. Some chefs in Indonesian sushi establishments for example,
have developed a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine with recipes
for krakatau roll, gado-gado roll, rendang roll[116] and gulai
ramen.[117] Several chefs and food industries have experimented
with fusing rendang with sandwiches, burgers and spaghetti.
Burger King at one time served their take on a rendang-flavoured
burger in their Singapore and Indonesia chains for a limited
promotion period.[118][119] Spaghetti with rendang could also be
found in 7-Eleven convenience stores across Indonesia.
Rendang is also a popular flavour in Indonesian instant noodle
variants, such as the Indomie Goreng Rendang.[120]
